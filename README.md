# Native-Bayes-Python-Simple  

I would use an algabraic system modeler to not make algebra mistakes on native bayes or keep your statistic book handy it's easy to make a math error. 
Excel may be better than python for some of this stuff, Especially Native Bayes, or Google Sheets, or LibreOffice Calc.
